----------------------
This project is a recreation of the infamous "Matrix Rain" effect from the "Matrix" line-up of movies. <br>
The code is written in python, and is by far one of the best replicas of the actual movie's effects on your terminal. <br>
<br>
You can either used the pre-existing configuration as available in the [dist](/dist/main) folder, or modify the [settings](/settings) file and run the [main.py](/main.py) file in your own terminal. 
You can extensively modify the settings.py file to change the height, width, speed, or colours of the terminal. <br>
You can enable/disable debugging options like Performance Metrics in the same file as well.

### Features-
1. True-to-source recreation of the effect, to the best of the terminal's capacity.
2. Highly modular code, easily change settings from the seperate settings.py file.
3. Extremely lightweight and performance friendly.
